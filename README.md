# ROS_Go_Chase_It

This was my first "real" attempt at doing something with ROS.  I've got to admit, it took some work to finally get everything working correctly.  So, if you're learning ROS ... stick to it.  It isn't going to give up easily!

## NOTE:
Initially I tried using the Udacity Workspace to get this thing going.  But my network connection (via ATT) was REALLY acting up and I wasn't able to get any real bandwidth for several days.  So, no biggie.  I'll just set up an environment on my laptop and run everything on it. 

Mistake!  I used the free version of VMWare (which is WAY COOL, by the way) and set up a Linux environment there.  The problem was, once I got to the point where I was trying to run Gazebo AND RVis at the same time ... my poor little laptop just ground to a hault.  Nuts!

O.K.  No problem.  I'll just move everything over onto my desktop.  A bigger CPU, more memory, and NVIDIA GPU; life should be good.

Mistake!  Apparently RVis doesn't play well with "some" video cards.  It just so happens, my older NVIDA GPU card is one of them.  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGHHHHHH!

O.K.  So it's been a few days of HELL and I finally got my ATT network service running at a half decent speed (what I've been paying them for all along).  Sooooo, back to the Udacity Workspace.  Finally got all the kinks worked out and everything running properly.  

Hope some of this is helpful.
